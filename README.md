# StockMarket


## Description 
A stock market is a platform that has stocks listed on it and investing accounts can use the platform to trade stocks. The current value of a stock on the market is actually the price of the last trade of that stock that occurred on the market. In order to trade stocks, investors (represented here by investing accounts) need to signal their intention to buy (make a bid) or to sell (asking for a certain price) to the stock market. Bids and asks are usually referred to as “orders”.
Sending a “bid” to the stock market means that you are sending to the market information about how much of a particular stock you want to buy and what price you are willing to pay per stock. Sending an “ask” to the stock market means that you are sending to the market information about how much of a particular stock you want to sell and what price you are asking for.
The stock market, as a platform/system, has the responsibility to monitor all the bids and asks that it receives, and make transactions happen. Transactions are made if and only if, for a particular stock, there is a bid (order to buy) with a price equal or superior to an asking price (order to sell).
